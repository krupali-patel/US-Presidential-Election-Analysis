# US-Presidential-Election-Analysis
This repository contains source code in R for analyzing 2016 United States Presidential Election Dataset.


## Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
(a) Use R to make a map of state-by-state percentage vote share of President Trump in the 2016 US presidential election. The data are stored in a CSV file in Input folder. Be sure to include Alaska and Hawaii in your map. Get the color scheme in your map to look like the one shown at

(for an unrelated dataset). It uses shades of red for Donald Trump and shades of blue for Hillary Clinton.  
</p>

(b) What does the map show? Justify your conclusions.


## Solution  
(a) The final output map is the file - <b>ElectionResult2016.jpg</b> in Output folder.  
<p align="justify">
(b) The following are the conclusions along justifications:  

  *	The map essentially shows state-by-state percentage vote share of President Donald Trump in 2016 US Presidential election.  
  *	<p align="justify">The states are colored according majority of vote share in the election. If the state is colored in RED shades, that means Donald Trump has more than 50% vote share than Hillary Clinton for that state. It means he is leading in those states. </p>
    Similarly, if a state is colored in the shades of blue that means Hillary Clinton shares higher percentage of vote share       than Donald Trump.</p>
  *	<p align="justify">From map, we observe that the President Donald Trump has got maximum share of the votes from the central region of the United States of America, whereas Hillary Clinton has got maximum share of the votes from Eastern and Western region of the United States of America. </p>  
  *	<p align="justify">From the map, we can say that, states favoring President Donald Trump lie in the central region whereas his contender Hillary Clinton is been favored by the states that are located in bay areas (both eastern and western).</p>
  *	Donald Trump won 30 states whereas Hillary Clinton 20 states.
